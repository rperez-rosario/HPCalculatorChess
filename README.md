# HPCalculatorChess
A chess game implemented on/for the HP Prime Graphing Calculator using its api and programming language (HP PPL.)

<pre>The program is structured around the con-
cept of processing user or intelligent a-
gent (i.a.) input affecting the game's 
state, and updating the user interface ba-
sed on said state as the user or i.a. in-
put loop is consumed by the program. This
concept is commonly known as the model, 
view, controller (MVC) software design pa-
ttern.</pre>

The main four (4) program functions are:

<pre>a_chess: Main program/entry point. Calls
         the other main functions, and 
         implements and executes the pla-
         yer's and/or i.a.'s input loop. 
a_igst:  Initializes and stores the game's
         current state (model.)
a_pui:   Prints the game's user interface
         based on the game's current sta-
         te (view.)
a_ppi:   Processes user or i.a. input and
         affects the game's current state 
         accordingly (controller.)</pre>

<pre>This program was designed, implemented and
tested during  the  2020  global  COVID-19
pandemic in  Brooklyn and  Manhattan, NYC,
U.S.A. Please remember to  wear your mask!</pre>
